    <h1><strong>Wonderland's blog</strong></h1>

      <p>Hello! Welcome to my first website building blog. As I'm learning about technology in the First Nation Technology Council, I have learned that you need to ask questions, listen to the teacher, and do the step-by-step instructions. As a learner I have been learning; Miscoft Word, files, digital communications, Cisco, and many others things. I would the most chanllanging one yet, is coding. I love it and hate it. Anyways, this website is about my photos and the advetures I have gone with friends and family. </p>

      <h1> My sister and I walking along the water falls. </h1>
      <p> This is my sister, whom is a couple years older than me. She is my friend and sister. We laugh at silly stuff like animes and manga issues. She is self-driven person. The other photo is my other sister. Jessica, I remember hiding from her the most, and lovely memories of her pancakes. She one I turn when I love a book! Jess, is a book-lover as well. More chapter, fantasy type of books. There isn't more precious than having a family member a friend to talk with. </p>
