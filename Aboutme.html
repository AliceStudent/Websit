      <p>Hello!</p>

    <img src="images/alicen2.jpg" alt="me" width="550" height="500" />

      <p> This is me, I am happy to learn about new things in life; such as, technology terms, programs, and photography skills. I know it's important for some people to have money as their goals in life. Better themselves. Invest into a houses, vocations trips, and cars. Not to say, money wins everything. I can't live in a box. Money can solve the needs of renting, foods supplies, heats, cell phone bills, and insurnces. I do believe that money can help, it just it can't be everything in life. </p>
